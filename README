This code takes the UCI HAR Dataset and cleans it up into a tidy dataset. To run the code, the dataset must be already downloaded and the directory structure preserved. 

run_analysis.R takes the path to the UCI HAR Dataset directory as input. It merges the test and training samples into one sample, selects a subset of the features, and writes the output dataframe to a file. The features chosen are only those corresponding to a mean or standard deviation, plus the numeric ID identifying the subject, and the activity the subject was undertaking. Descriptions of the columns in the ouput file are given in CODEBOOK.Rmd.
